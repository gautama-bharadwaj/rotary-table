This is the readme file for Rotary table project. There are 3 codes.
1-motor.c
2-motor_server.c
3-client.c

motor.c can be executed independently without client/server program
If socket programming needs to be executed, motor_server.c and client.c should be executed simultaneously in the Raspberry Pi and the remote controlling device.

In the stepper motor used, 
1 step = 1.8 degrees

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
1- motor.c : This program accepts 3 arguments from the command line.
First arg - Direction - 0 or 1 [0 is clockwise and 1 is anticlockwise]
Second arg - Steps to be rotated - 0 to the required steps. [200 steps = 360 degree rotation| 25 steps = 45 degrees | 50 steps = 90 degrees and so on]
Third arg - Delay - This argument controls the speed of the motor. A minimum of 2500 Microseconds delay should be provided.

Example : ./motor 0 200 2500
The above code rotates the motor for 360 degrees in clockwise direction
		  ./motor 1 25 10000
The above code rotates the motor for 45 degrees in anti-clockwise direction. The speed of rotation is much lesser than the previous example due to the increase in delay.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
2- motor_server.c : This program acts as the server in socket programming. This rotates the motor in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction depending on the command from the client program.
If the user enters "1" in the client program, the motor will rotate clockwise
If the user enters "2" in the client program, the motor will rotate anti-clockwise

The number of steps and delay should be modified in this program if need be.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
3- client.c : This program runs on a remote machine. The IP address of Raspberry Pi should be entered in the program. The user will be prompted to press 1 or 0.
If the user enters "1", the information will be communicated to the motor_server.c program and clockwise rotation will occur.
If the user enters "0", the information will be communicated to the motor_server.c program and anti-clockwise rotation will occur.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Relation between "Delay" and "RPM" :

Suppose 60 RPM is necessary.
60 RPM = 1 RPS
1 RPS = 200 steps/s
Time per step (ms) = 1000/200 = 5ms
Ton = 2.5ms and Toff = 2.5ms
Delay = 2.5ms = 2500 Microseconds
